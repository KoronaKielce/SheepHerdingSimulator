In order to access the game you can either clone this repository and paste it into a new project in unity (if you have Unity downloaded)...

Or:
  1. you can go to the master branch and click on the "SneakPeekPlayable.zip" at the bottom of the list of files
  2. from there you should see an empty screen and click on "view raw" to download a playable builded version of the game
  3. the file should download, and from there open it and extract the compressed data
  4. after that click into the file until you see a list of 3 files and 3 folders
  5. click onto the file that says "sheepherdingExperimental"
  6. and from there the game should open!
     Thank you and enjoy!
